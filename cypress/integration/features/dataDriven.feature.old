Feature: Data Driven testing   
    Scenario Outline: Check with table data 
        Given I have a file json as data
        When I check with <name>
        Then I will see their age is <age>
        And I will see they own a <car>
        Examples: 
            | name | age | car |
            | John | 30 |  |
            | Joe | 32 | Lamborghini |
            | Trump |  | Lincon |
            | Biden | 75 | Vinfast |
